Steps to Compile from Source: 
  # download & configure the Android source tree
  # download postgresql-8.4.1
  # download the psqldroid patch
  # extract the postgres archive and move the directory to external/postgresql under your Android source tree
  # change into the external/postgresql directory
  # apply the psqldroid patch
  # run 'sh create-symbolic-links.sh'
  # change to the root of the android source tree
  # make psql

Notes: 
  * This is known to work with the Android Donut release, but probably others as well
  * Once the compilation completes, you will find binaries under target/out/...
